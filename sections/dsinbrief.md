**Founder's Story** <br>

I like the 3rd saying because unlike the others, it shows a proactive mentality. WE should not be reacting with the changes around us - but we are proactively making the change we want to see in our life and our community.

This is my mentality when founding DSinbrief.

As an Econ & Math student who wants to pivot into DS, I’ve been looking for a community to share knowledge, learn and grow with others. The desire to be part of a young community of DS learners and the fact that I haven’t found one motivates me to create one. As soon as I had this idea, I’ve posted about it on other online science communities to ask for feedback and one of them was Data Science & Big Data VN. I was surprised to receive so much positive feedback and support from my peers, strangers and even professionals in the field within just 20 hours.

After planning and drafting the very first few articles, I published Data Science in Brief - a science page and an online community that connects DS enthusiasts, learners and practitioners – WE are initiating an effort in strengthening the DS community in VN - which has remained a challenge to current institutes, training agencies and even big companies.

**Mission** <br>

DSinbrief's missions are ***knowledge sharing*** and ***community building***.

We promote **knowledge sharing** by providing quality summaries of articles or blog posts about everything a data scientist should know. we want to bring data science closer to the public, to inspire young learners and to keep experienced scientists updated with sota practices & applications. We do it by nurturing a FB group where everyone is encouraged to raise a voice.

As a **community**, we help DS enthusiasts navigate through their career choices. Experts come to share their experience and be a resource for younger learners. And learners come to ask questions and to learn. This way we also help young DS learners navigate through Grad school & Career OPTIONS - by connecting them with real Data scientists for learning and career advice.
