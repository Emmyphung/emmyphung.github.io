I am Emmy Phung, a Machine Learning Engineer currently pursuing an **MS in Data Science at NYU**. I have research and industry experience in machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), probabilistic time series and recommender system. 

I love working in teams, tackling new data challenges as well as seeking original approaches to existing problems. I have just finished my **Data Science & Optimization internship** with **ATIM** (Advanced Technologies for Investment Management) at **Fidelity Investments**, in which I proposed a deep learning approach to a conventional time series modelling problem and enabled the team to first time ever simulate market volatitlity over a long time horizon (10 years+) using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with auto-encoder deployed on AWS Sagemaker. I also helped the team eliminate the manual data-cleansing process in Excel and enhance data quality by automating the imputation process using multiple chained equations (MICE framework) in Python.

Graduating soon, I aspire to turn ideas into actionable solutions and unlock new potentials from data with my solid programming skills and theoretical knowledge in data science.

I also have a passion for knowledge sharing and community building. With a hope to share my learning journey in Data Science with others and support the VN DS community, I have founded and am managing **Data Science in Brief**, a science page and an online community that connects DS enthusiasts, learners and practitioners. DSinbrief is initiating an effort in connecting and strengthening the DS community in VN, which has remained a challenge to current institutes, training agencies and even big companies.
Within a year, I have grown a team of 20 young data scientists [more]
