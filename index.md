<div> The purpose of this data mining project is to examine how restaurants can improve their Yelp profile to become more “successful” on Yelp in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
<br>
Our methodology defines “success” as a binary variable through an exploratory analysis of the restaurants’ review counts and ratings on Yelp. Feature variables include categories and attributes that Yelp users can use to select which restaurant to visit. For this project, we ran Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression to explore key features associated with “success” and obtain recommendations for restaurants to improve their Yelp profile.
<br>
Models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.

<div> This project analyzes stock prices of big tech companies, Facebook - Apple - Amazon - Netflix - Google (FAANG) and sees how they progressed throughout the two recent presidential election (2012 - Barack Obama and 2017 - Donald Trump).

<div> This notebook will compare the performance of two NLP techniques, Count Vectorizor and TF-IDF Vectorizer, and two classification models, Logistic Regression and Bernoulli Naive Bayes in sentiment analysis. I'll give detailed explanation on which model performs better and why.<div/>
