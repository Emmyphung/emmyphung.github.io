<div style="text-align: justify">The purpose of this data mining project is to examine how restaurants can improve their Yelp profile to become more “successful” on Yelp in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Differently from the traditional approaches to this dataset, our methodology defines “success” as a binary variable through an exploratory analysis of the restaurants’ review counts and ratings on Yelp. Feature variables include categories and attributes that Yelp users can use to select which restaurant to visit. For this project, we ran Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression to explore key features associated with “success” and obtain recommendations for restaurants to improve their Yelp profile. Final results indicate that determinants of success vary by cuisine type.

Finally, I created recommender system that restaurant owners can use to study their top competitors. Given the name of the restaurant and the cuisine, the system will output top 10 competitors of that restaurant based on their similarities in attributes..</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project I am going to perform comprehensive EDA on the breast cancer dataset, then transform the data using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and use Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict whether a patient has breast cancer.</div>

**Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews: Logistic Regression vs. Naive Bayes Bernoulli**

[![View on Github](https://img.shields.io/badge/Colab-Run_in_Google_Colab-blue?logo=Google&logoColor=FDBA18)](https://github.com/Emmyphung/Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/Sentiment%20Analysis%20-%20NLP%20and%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)

<div style="text-align: justify">This notebook will compare the performance of two NLP techniques, Count Vectorizor and TF-IDF Vectorizer, and two classification models, Logistic Regression and Bernoulli Naive Bayes in sentiment analysis. I'll give detailed explanation on which model performs better and why.</div>

[**Kaggle Competition: Google QUEST Q&A Labelling**](https://chriskhanhtran.github.io/projects/ames-house-price.html)

<div style="text-align: justify"> Google Q&A Labelling is a classification problem. Given pairs of questions and answers, we are asked to classify the question types, answer types, level of helpfulness of the answers, etc. For this project, I conducted comprehensive EDA to understand the datasets and important variables, used Multilabel Stratified KFolds to solve class imbalance issue, and used BERT pretuned models to solve the classification problems.</div>

[**Detect Food Trends from Facebook Posts: Co-occurence Matrix, Lift and PPMI**](https://chriskhanhtran.github.io/projects/detect-food-trends-facebook.html)

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](https://chriskhanhtran.github.io/projects/detect-food-trends-facebook.html)
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/facebook-detect-food-trends)

<div style="text-align: justify">First I build co-occurence matrices of ingredients from Facebook posts from 2011 to 2015. Then, to identify interesting and rare ingredient combinations that occur more than by chance, I calculate Lift and PPMI metrics. Lastly, I plot time-series data of identified trends to validate my findings. Interesting food trends have emerged from this analysis.</div>

[![Open Research Poster](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Open_Research_Poster-blue?logo=adobe-acrobat-reader&logoColor=white)](https://chriskhanhtran.github.io/pdf/bac2018.pdf)

<div style="text-align: justify">In three-month research and a two-day hackathon, I led a team of four students to discover insights from 6 million records of NYC and Boston government spending data sets and won runner-up prize for the best research poster out of 18 participating colleges.</div>
