  Engineers build the engine behind a product and business leaders give it a soul. I want to bridge the gap between engineers and business leaders and guide their decisions through data science. <br> 
  Currently pursuing an MS in Data Science at NYU Center for Data Science, my goal is to attain mastery over data science to translate consumer insights into data-intensive product solutions.
